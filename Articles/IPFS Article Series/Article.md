Web 3 is really big right now. Youâ€™ve probably heard of writing programs (aka smart contracts) in chains like Ethereum and other prominent networks. But what about storing big chunks of data? Something like a 4K video, or a cat image for example. How do we go on about storing those in decentralised networks?

The go-to way of storing data as such is by using something known as IPFS.

## So, What is IPFS?

Interplanetary File System or IPFS for short is a protocol (and a peer to peer network) for storing and accessing files in a decentralised web instead of using a centralised server.

So before we deep dive into what IPFS is, letâ€™s take a look at how things work in the current Web2.0.
Imagine you want to access a file that is stored in a sever. This server might be serving requests that come to the domain, say example.com. 
If a file `Cat.jpg` exists in that server and you want to access it, you might go to an address such as `https://example.com/Cat.jpg.` This is known as Location based addressing as you just requested a particular address (example.com) for a particular image. 

The issue with such an approach is

- Youâ€™re asking one centralised server to send a response data
- It is entirely possible that the server returns a dog image even though you asked for a cat image.

The way IPFS solves this issue is by using:

1. **A decentralised network of nodes to share data.**
What this means is that when you upload some data to the ipfs network, it is not being sent to a central server, but instead is stored across the decentralised network .
2. **Naming data with respect to their content**
Every piece of data in the ipfs network is given its own unique identifier know as **CID** or **Content Identifier.** This means a file name will be indicative of the data it contains and any change in the data will make a change in the CID as well, thereby acting as a means to verify the integrity of the file.

To get started with using ipfs, you can visit the [wikipedia mirror](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Wikipedia.html) hosted on the ipfs network.

The link above is known as a gateway. There are many public gateways available, with the one above (`https://ipfs.io/`) being from the official ipfs team.

### Installing IPFS Desktop

To interact directly with the network and to store data in it, we can use the IPFS Desktop application.  [Install it from here.](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/)

Youâ€™ll be greeted with an interface like this:

Go to the Files Tab and click the **Import** button to upload a file.

Once youâ€™ve uploaded it, use the more icon on the side, to get its public shareable link using the ipfs gateway (similar to this: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYKEp564QwWJEUuzAy4s8VcPnptFNGygaM7FoMaZkoC5t?filename=Cat.jpeg)

Ipfs URLs with the ipfs.io gateway look like this:
```
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>
```

The search param `?filename=Cat.jpeg` is only a convenience for when the user downloads the file and is not a required part of the URL. You can also use a different gateway such as the pinata public gateway to access the same file https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYKEp564QwWJEUuzAy4s8VcPnptFNGygaM7FoMaZkoC5t (Sneak peek -> weâ€™ll look into pinata in the upcoming articles :)

You can also copy its CID and share it, which can be used by other peers to get the image.


### Installing IPFS Companion

The ipfs suite also comes with a browser extension which will intercept `ipfs://` type links and automatically route them through your local node.

Install it using the following links

[Install it for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch)

[Install it for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/)

or go to the official website for more [instructions](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/#install).

When weâ€™re using a public gateway, weâ€™re receiving data from the public servers that the gateway exposes, which looks something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75270610/178286551-fc356e31-cfdd-4035-a2b8-b7d4d73f65de.png)

once youâ€™ve installed ipfs companion, try opening the [above cat image link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYKEp564QwWJEUuzAy4s8VcPnptFNGygaM7FoMaZkoC5t?filename=Cat.jpeg) once again.

Youâ€™ll notice that your URL changes to something similar to this (will be a bit different)(Your local node will need to be running for this to work):

```http://bafybeieuhbcjdmdlwzko4slkuhgd4ddtjauu64taecrxup5y3r3hpeymy4.ipfs.localhost:8080/?filename=Cat.jpeg```

This is ipfs companion altering the URL to use your local node. This means now youâ€™re receiving the image directly from the network, and no third party gateways are being used!!

And thatâ€™s it, weâ€™ve successfully used IPFS to store and view data!!
