## Application Workflow Storyboard

***üñ•Ô∏è Frontend***

1. ***User Interface:*** Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for event organizers and attendees to interact with.
2. ***Event Creation:*** Develop a form or wizard-like interface for event organizers to create event pages, add event details, set ticket prices, and customize event pages.
3. ***Ticketing System:*** Design a ticketing system for attendees to purchase tickets securely and easily.
4. ***Event Search and Filtering:*** Implement search and filtering options to help users find relevant events based on location, category, date, etc.
5. ***Event Management:*** Build an interface for event organizers to manage their events, track registrations, and make updates to event details.
6. ***Analytics and Reporting:*** Provide event organizers with analytics and reporting features to track event performance, ticket sales, and attendee engagement.

***üìú Smart contract requirements***

***‚ûú. Functional requirements:***

1. ***Integration:*** Explore leveraging blockchain technology for aspects such as ticketing, registration, and payment systems. This could involve utilizing smart contracts, decentralized identity, or decentralized storage solutions.
2. ***Tokenization:*** Implementing a native token system within the application. Tokens can be used for various purposes such as rewarding attendees, enabling access to exclusive features, or facilitating peer-to-peer transactions.
3. ***Decentralized Storage:*** Explore using decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store event data, images, and other media files. This ensures data availability and reduces reliance on centralized servers.
4. ***Interoperability:*** Consider how the application can interact with other decentralized applications (DApps) or blockchain networks. This could involve integrating with existing decentralized identity systems or allowing users to connect their wallets from different blockchain networks. (e.g, chainlink)

***‚ûú Non-functional requirements:***

1. ***Privacy and Security:*** Ensure user data protection and that privacy is maintained within the Web3 environment. Explore encryption techniques and decentralized identity solutions to enhance security.
2. ***Community Engagement:*** Leverage the power of Web 3 technologies to facilitate community engagement and participation. This could involve implementing decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing users to contribute to event planning, or incorporating social features like decentralized
messaging.
3. ***UX/UI Design:*** Design the user interface to be seamless and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with blockchain-related functionalities. Consider providing clear instructions and feedback to guide users through the Web3 experience.
4. ***Education and Onboarding:*** Since Web3 technologies may be unfamiliar to some users, consider providing educational resources and onboarding materials to help users understand the benefits and functionalities of the Web3 environment.

***üëå Unique Features to Enhance our application***
